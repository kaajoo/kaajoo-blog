					<p>It is the matter of 18th century that or say 175 years ago that they entered Nepal. 
					<strong>Maharaja Ranjit Singh from Punjab</strong> had a good rapport with the then patriot of our country <strong>Amar Singh Thapa</strong>, rather say Rajnit singh was regarded as His guru. After Ranjit Singh passed away, East India Company gave a plenty of troubles to his wife named <strong>Jinda Kaur</strong>. Consequently, she ran away from there, and came to Nepal via Nepalgunj along with her kith and kin and courtiers and Amar Singh Thapa gave her shelter and regarded her as her own sister. Later she went to London. But those who were left in Nepal, started their livelihood in Nepal. Gradually generation after generation, their population grew and they have become Nepali, Sikh. There is still a territory in Nepalgunj near Indian border but lies in Nepal, which has been named “Shikhhanpura”. They r still living there and most of them r enjoying their rural life. They have their different profession but rather in automobile profession.
					
					</p>
					
					<h3 class="orange">Sikhs' Role to pave the way for Roads In Nepal</h3>
					<p>
					<strong>It is believed that 60 or 70 years ago, there were no road facilities in Nepal. It is the contribution of Sikh community that they, courageously, started their driving in Nepal and it is they who contributed a lot to make the beaten track (Goreto Bato) .  After Nepalgunj, Sikh community started living in the border areas basically like Birgunj, Biratnagar and Bhairawa.</strong>
					</p>
					<p> 
					In Birgunj, a young and energetic Nepali Sikh named <strong>Jaspal Singh</strong>’s forefathers played a vital role in <strong>introducing different kind of cold drinks like Limka, Thumps Up, Gold Spot</strong> exported from India via Patna. And his father <strong class="orange">Late Ragbir Singh</strong> introduced Coke, Fanta and  Soda in Birgunj. Moreover, it was he who established <strong>Shere Panjab Hotel</strong> for the first time in Birgunj around Paan Mandi Galli which lasted for five or seven years and with the same name the hotel was established in Hetauda too for ten years. 
					</p>
					
					
					<h3 class="orange">The meaning of Sardaar</h3>
					<p>
					Many people don’t have the knowledge as why Sikh Community has an Adjective called <strong>Saradaar</strong>. In fact, it is an honor given to them as a leader who can lead everybody very honestly as Sikhs are famous for their <strong>honesty, sincerity, credibility, confidentiality, commitment, dedication, devotion</strong> globally and they are supposed to be the man of words and principles
					</p>
					
					
					<h3 class="orange">The significance of Five Kakkars in Sikh Community.</h3>
					<p>
					Five Kakkars have a symbolic meaning of their feature. Respectively, they stand for: <br>
					<strong>Kesh</strong> ( Hair)<br>
					<strong>Kaiyo</strong> ( Comb)<br>
					<strong>Kada</strong> ( hand –cuff)<br>
					<strong>Kirpan</strong> ( A kind of small sword which they always keep around their waist)<br>
					<strong>Kachhara</strong> ( a kind of traditional Underwear)<br>
					</p>
					
					
					
					
					<h3 class="orange">How do Sikhs conduct their religious rites in Guru Dwara?</h3>
					
					<p>
					I went to Guru Dwara located at Shreepur, Birgunj, for my field study in order to know as how they perform their religious rites. I found as follows:-</p>
					
					<p><strong>1.</strong> There is a priest named <strong>Govinda Singh</strong> aged 22, who is known as Gyani ( Bhai Ji). He conducts all the religious rites,  he recites adoration which is known as <strong>Gurbani</strong> in Sikh community. Very surprisingly, the priest is the son of Dalit community from Paswan Caste originally from Siraha, Dumari 1. In fact his father named <strong>Hari singh</strong>, long ago, had gone to Ludhiyana for doing a job. When he came across the Sikh culture, as there is no disparity and discrimination among people, he adopted Sikhism and inclined to it. Consequently, he learnt everything required for being a priest in Sikh Community. Later in 2047, he was brought to Birgunj who is known as Sebadaar Saheb means serves everybody. His son mentioned above named Govinda Singh is Bhai ji there. Both father and son are altruistically have been showering their services over the last 20 years.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>2. </strong>In the Guru Dwara of Birgunj, there is a sort of small cement-made pond filled with water, before entering the Guru Dwara, everybody has to put off their any kind of foot wearing stuff and wash their feet and sprinkle the same water in their body and sip a wee of water as a <strong>Prasad</strong> known as <strong>Nectar</strong>. If people from other community go to observe the Guru Dwara, they have to cover their head with their hanky or cover their head with some clothes.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>3. </strong>In any Guru Dwara of the world, there are two kinds of religious flags which are known as “ Nishansaheb. In there, there is a big hall where all can sit together and have whatever prasads are made and given; the hall is known Langar Hall in Sikh language. And there is managed a community Kitchen where people can go and cook whatever materials are available there. Any kinds of intoxicated materials, socks, shoes and sleepers are strictly prohibited inside the GuruDwara. Volunteers feel it as a great religious work to wipe out the pots and utensils in the GuruDwara. They have a great respect for all the people belonging to any community, there are no rooms for disparity and discrimination.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>4. </strong>Like Hindus have four Dhams similarly, Sikhs have five "<strong>Takhtas</strong>". They are in <strong>Patna (Main Guru Dwara), Amritsar (Swarna Mandir), KeshGadh Saheb (Anandapur,Punjab), Dadama Saheb (Punjab), Hajur Saheb (Maharastra)</strong>. Five Takhtas have been given state honour by the Govt of India.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>5. </strong>While entering Darbaar, we find a specious place where the symbol of Guru with some similes of Wahe Guru is available which is known as five <strong>Kakaars</strong> and separate room is there where bed is set up for the sleep of <strong>Aadi Granth Shree Guru Grantha Saheb ji</strong>. Guru's commandments are highly appreciated ad taken as a commandment and each has to do the stuff commanded by Him who is supposed to be Living God. The bed is which is set up for Him is known as <strong>Sukhasan</strong> cleaned and set up everyday by Gyani Ji. A kind of Prasad (<strong>bounty</strong>) known as <strong>Porridge</strong> (Haluwa, made of flour, ghee and sugar of same amount (Popularly known as <strong>Kadah Prasad</strong>). Gram (<strong>Channa</strong>) is also taken as Prasad.  
					
					</p>
					
					<p></p>
					
					<h3 class="orange">Why did a huge number of Sikh communities displace from Birgunj?</h3>
					
					<p>Just before 15 years, there were 400/500 sikh family in Birgunj having 2025 members all together, but very sad to explain that right now there are only50 family having 250 members and that too, most of them are planning to move away from here since their children are in India and having a very sophisticated life over there.</p>
					<p>
					A young man belonging to Sikh community named <strong>Jaspal Singh</strong>, who has a great pride to be a Nepali, told me the following reasons as why Sikh communities are displacing from Birgunj:-</p>
					<p>
					<strong>1. </strong>Maoist insurgency had paralyzed their transportation business due to regular closures and strikes since their main profession is transportation</p>
					<p>
					<strong>2. </strong>State did not give due values to them despite their contribution and sacrifices to build big-big road tracks and transportation accessibility in the nook and corner of the country and that too, they were not provided citizenship in spite of spending long years in Nepal. In lack of their citizenship, they used to buy their properties and land under the name of those who had citizenship having faith in them and believing that one day they would get the citizenship. But they were cheated very badly and it also disheartened them very badly and caused to leave the place.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>3. </strong>Over the last 15 years, India got landslide economic growth that paved the way for industrialization and globalization which created a plenty of job opportunities or employment opportunities whereas the situation of Nepal has been going from bad to worse. It is the human nature that they want a safe landing where peace and security can be guaranteed 
					</p>
					
					
					
					<h3 class="orange">Lack of social security of Sikh Community in Birgunj</h3>
					<p>
					 According to <strong>Jaspal Singh</strong>, there is no social security for them. He made an ironic smile saying that those who took their citizenships yesterday look at them as if they were no Nepali and they make sarcastic remarks looking at them. He said "<strong>how long shall we keep waiting believing that the situation will get better? Our patience will leave working. Anyways, we have no options except Wait and Watch if not I don’t think except me, anybody will stay here.</strong>" He said a very emotional matter that there is no representative of <strong>Sikh Community in Constituent Assembly</strong> which is known as the most inclusive Constituent Assembly of the world. It is a big joke for our community. Then how we can believe that there is our social security. When asked the question as why the people of your community have not been involved in politics. He replied "<strong>it’s a dirty game on the one hand and on the other hand no political parties have ever made any approaches about our institute.</strong>" He said "<strong>now it’s too much. So I think we should also conduct some peaceful procession if not hold strikes to pressurize the deaf and dumb government. It is a really a very pathetic story of Sikh Community in Nepal.</strong>"</p>
					 <p>
					<strong class="orange">It has been found that hardly any youths are available in Birgunj. Most of them are in India for their further education and career and a very few are in Katmandu. If they get better opportunities out there, why should they come to Nepal?</strong>
